## React Template by [@RokasAniss](https://github.com/RokasAniss)

### VScode users:

Certain config files and directories are hidden from file explorer, to have a more immersive development experience. Open `.vscode/settings.json`, and unhide files and folders when you need them.

### Structure `(src/)`

- `src/components` UI components only, no direct connection to store or api calls in here

### `npm run generate`
Can help you generate the following:
- Component
- Container
- View
- Layout
- Store module
